meta-intel-edison
=================

This is the Intel Edison layer for the Intel Edison Development Platform. Here
are all the parts needed to build and flash a Yocto image for Intel Edison.

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  tag: yocto-1.6.1
  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel-iot-middleware
  branch: daisy
  To build the Windows Cross-compilation toolchain:
  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-mingw
  branch: daisy
  To build the MacOSX Cross-compilation toolchain:
  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-darwin
  branch: daisy

Quick Start
===========

1- Prepare your workspace:
$ mkdir my_Edison_Workspace

2- Get this layer:
$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel-edison

3- Make things easier with 'make':
$ ln -s meta-intel-edison/utils/Makefile.mk Makefile

4- Download all the needed dependencies:
$ make setup

5- Build Intel Edison Yocto distribution:
$ make edison-image

6- Flash the board:
$ make flash

Guidelines for submitting patches
=================================

Please submit any patches to the meta-intel mailing list
(meta-intel@yoctoproject.org). Also, if your patches are available via a public
git repository, please also include a URL to the repo and branch containing
your patches as that makes it easier for maintainers to grab and test your
patches.

Regardless of how you submit a patch or patchset, the patches should
at minimum follow the suggestions outlined in the 'How to Submit a
Change' section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.  Specifically,
they should:

  - Include a 'Signed-off-by:' line.  A commit can't legally be pulled
    in without this.

  - Provide a single-line, short summary of the change. This short
    description should be prefixed by the BSP or recipe name, as
    appropriate, followed by a colon.  Capitalize the first character
    of the summary (following the colon).

  - For the body of the commit message, provide detailed information
    that describes what you changed, why you made the change, and the
    approach you used.

  - If the change addresses a specific bug or issue that is associated
    with a bug-tracking ID, include a reference to that ID in your
    detailed description in the following format: [YOCTO #<bug-id>].

  - Pay attention to line length - please don't allow any particular
    line in the commit message to stretch past 72 characters.

  - For any non-trivial patch, provide information about how you
    tested the patch, and for any non-trivial or non-obvious testing
    setup, provide details of that setup.

Doing a quick 'git log' will provide you with many
examples of good example commits if you have questions about any
aspect of the preferred format.

The maintainers will do their best to review and/or pull in a patch or patchset
within 48 hours of the time it was posted. For larger and/or more involved
patches and patchsets, the review process may take longer.
